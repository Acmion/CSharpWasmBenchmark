# JavaScriptCore
The main goal of this directory is to replicate the C# code in the directory "./Core",
but in JavaScript. However, not all code is replicated, because it is dynamically 
generated "CSharpWasmBenchmark/Pages/js/Index.cshtml". 

The rationale behind this is that with this configuration only the C# code has 
to be maintained in most cases.
