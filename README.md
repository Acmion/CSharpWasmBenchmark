# CSharpWasmBenchmark
Comparing the performances of C# Runtime, C# Wasm AOT, C# Wasm Interpreted and JavaScript.

**Note:** The C# Wasm benchmarks are compiled with Uno.Wasm.Bootstrap, which is using some sort of preview .NET 6 tech.
The benchmarks failed when using Blazor Wasm Interpreted, due to some memory error. I will include .NET 6 Blazor in this benchmark, 
whenever it gets ready.
